## Introduction

In this project, you will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive story with animated text and characters that are triggered when the user scrolls.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Webpages used to just be static and boring, but modern websites add <span style="color: #0faeb0">**interaction**</span> to grab a viewer's attention and make the online experience more fun and interesting. 
</p>

You will:
+ Track the position of elements
+ Set images to load only when they are needed
+ Create your own HTML page
+ Animate text and image elements when they come into view
