## Introduction

In this project, you will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create an interactive story with features that are triggered when the user scrolls. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Websites often use <span style="color: #0faeb0">**interactive**</span> features to make the online experience more fun and interesting.
</p>

You will:
+ Track the position of elements
+ Animate elements when they come into view
+ Create your own html page
+ Set images to load only when they are needed
