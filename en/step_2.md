## Observing elements

In this step, you will use the 'Intersection observer' to observe an element and use its position to affect a different element.

--- task ---

Open the [Animated story starter project](https://staging-editor.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/animated-story-starter){:target="_blank"}.

--- /task ---

Your starter project contains:
+ an HTML page with some images and text
+ a CSS file that contains styling for some of the content
+ the images you will use in the project
+ a JavaScript file that you will develop throughout the project.

###Â console.log()

`console.log()` is a used to output messages that tell you what the JavaScript code is doing.

You can use `console.log()` for testing and debugging your code.

### Watch for something entering the viewport

JavaScript can be used to watch for ('observe') an html element with the `id=hideBounce` attribute and log something to the console when it appears in the viewport.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
The <span style="color: #0faeb0">**viewport**</span> is the area of the webpage that is currently visible in the browser.
</p>

--- task ---

Open the `scripts.js` file.

Add the observer that checks if the element with the attribute `id=hideBounce` has entered the viewport.

--- code ---

language: js
filename: scripts.js
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 3-8

window.onload = function () {
  // Hide bounce observer
  const bounceObserver = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    if (entries[0].isIntersecting) {
      console.log("BOUNCE TRIGGER IN VIEWPORT");
    }
  });
  bounceObserver.observe(document.getElementById("hideBounce"));

  // Image observer

--- /code ---
 
 **Tip:** Separate the different observer functions using a space.

### Hide text

The index page has some bouncing text at the bottom telling you to 'SCROLL DOWN'.

**Test:** Scroll down. You will see that the 'SCROLL DOWN' text gets in the way of other content. 

In addition to triggering a Console.log message, the element with the `id=hideBounce` can be used to hide the bouncing 'SCROLL DOWN' text, which has the attribute `id=bounce`.

--- task ---

Add the JavaScript code to change the value of the `opacity` property of the bouncing text.

Setting the opacity value to `0` will make it invisible.

--- code ---
---
language: js
filename: scripts.js
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 6
---

window.onload = function () {
  // Hide bounce observer
  const bounceObserver = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    if (entries[0].isIntersecting) {
      console.log("BOUNCE TRIGGER IN VIEWPORT");
      document.getElementById("bounce").style.opacity = 0;
    }
  });
  bounceObserver.observe(document.getElementById("hideBounce"));

  // Image observer

--- /code ---

Click the **Run** button to see the changes you have made. 

When you scroll down, the bouncing text 'SCROLL DOWN' will disappear!

## Save your project

Your project is saved automatically. Return to the starter link in the same web browser to see your changes. 

Next you are going to improve browser performance by only loading images when they are needed.




JS

  const bounceObserver = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    if (entries[0].isIntersecting) {
      console.log("BOUNCE TRIGGER IN VIEWPORT");
      document.getElementById("bounce").style.opacity = 0;
    }
  });
  bounceObserver.observe(document.getElementById("hideBounce"));
